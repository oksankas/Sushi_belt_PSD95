Here we adapted the sushi-belt model (Williams et al., 2016) to model the distribution of endogenous post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) across the dendritic tree of excitatory neuron types in intact mouse brain. PSD95 is a highly abundant scaffolding protein in excitatory synapses that interacts with more than 100 postsynaptic proteins, organising them into complexes and super-complexes which facilitate the processing of incoming signals into the cell (REFS). PSD95 is essential for learning and memory and its mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental and behavioural disorders, e.g. Schizophrenia, ASD and bipolar disease (REFs). Our modelling of PSD95 distribution reveals which cellular processes can feasibly explain the complex protein distribution patterns observed in excitatory neuron types. Additionally, our model implicates specific cellular processes that alter during development and ageing in the brain to produce changed patterns of molecular distribution of synaptic proteins

This code is design to simulate and identify extended sushi-belt model describing trafficking of proteins and RNA within neurons.

The model is based on the code from [that repository](https://github.com/ahwillia/Williams-etal-Synaptic-Transport) and [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20556).
